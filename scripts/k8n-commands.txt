#Step 1: Update the version of the app

#To list your deployments:
kubectl get deployments

#To list the running Pods:
kubectl get pods

#To view the current image version of the app:
kubectl describe pods

#To update the image of the application to version 2, use the set image command, followed by the deployment name and the new image version:
kubectl set image <deployment-name> <new-deployment-name>:v2


#Step 2: Verify an update
#First, let’s check that the App is running. To find out the exposed IP and Port we can use describe service:
kubectl describe <deployment-name>

#Create an environment variable called NODE_PORT that has the value of the Node port assigned:
export NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get <deployment-name> -o go-template='{{(index .spec.ports 0).nodePort}}')
echo NODE_PORT=$NODE_PORT

#Next, we’ll do a curl to the the exposed IP and port:
curl $(minikube ip):$NODE_PORT

#We hit a different Pod with every request and we see that all Pods are running the latest version (v2).
#The update can be confirmed also by running a rollout status command:
kubectl rollout status <deployment-name>


#Step 3: Rollback an update
#Let’s perform another update, and deploy image tagged as v10 :
kubectl set image <deployment-name> kubernetes-bootcamp=gcr.io/google-samples/kubernetes-bootcamp:v10

#See the status of the deployment:
kubectl get deployments

#And something is wrong… We do not have the desired number of Pods available. List the Pods again:
kubectl get pods

#A describe command on the Pods should give more insights:
kubectl describe pods

#There is no image called v10 in the repository. Let’s roll back to our previously working version. We’ll use the rollout undo command:
kubectl rollout undo <new-deployment-name>

#The rollout command reverted the deployment to the previous known state (v2 of the image). Updates are versioned and you can revert to any previously know state of a Deployment. List again the Pods:
kubectl get pods

#Four Pods are running. Check again the image deployed on the them:
kubectl describe pods

#We see that the deployment is using a stable version of the app (v2). The Rollback was successful.
